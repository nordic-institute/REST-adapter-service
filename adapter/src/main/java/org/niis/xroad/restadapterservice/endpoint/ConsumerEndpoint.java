/**
 * This class represents consumer endpoint and holds all the information that
 * is needed for publishing it. Consumer endpoint is identified by the
 * combination of HTTP verb and resource path, which is the part after
 * the base URL. E.g. http://base.com/resource-path. Resource path may contain
 * one or more resource id's that are marked as {resourceId}. E.g.
 * http://base.com/resource-path/{resourceId}/str/{resourceId}. The value
 * of the resource id variable is the rest of the URL starting from the first
 * curly bracket "{". E.g. "{resourceId}/str/{resourceId}".
 *
 * Client id is X-Road client id that must be defined on subsystem level:
 * instance.memberClass.memberCode.subsystem. Service id is X-Road service id
 * that must defined on service level:
 * instance.memberClass.memberCode.subsystem.service.version
